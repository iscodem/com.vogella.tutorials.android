== Canvas API

=== Introduction into the canvas API
		
The Canvas API allows to create complex graphical effects.
You paint on a `Bitmap` surface.
The `Canvas` class provides the drawing methods to draw on a bitmap.
The `Paint` class specifies how you draw on the bitmap.
		
	

=== The Canvas class
		
The `Canvas` object contains the bitmap on which you draw. 
It also provides methods for drawing operations:

* `drawARGB()` for drawing a color
* `drawBitmap()` to draw a `Bitmap`
* `drawText()` to draw a text
* `drawRoundRect()` to draw a rectangle with rounded corners and much more.
		
=== The Paint class
		
For drawing on the `Canvas` object you use an object of type `Paint`.
		
		
The `Paint` class allows to specify the color, font and certain effects for the drawing operation.
		
		
The `setStyle()` method allows to specify how it should be drawn. Option are to paint:
* Only the outline (`Paint.Style.STROKE`)
* the filled part (`Paint.Style.FILL`) 
* both the outline and the filled part (`Paint.Style.STROKE_AND_FILL`)
		
		
You can set the alpha channel of the
`Paint`
via the
`setAlpha()`
method.
		
		
Via
_Shaders_
you can define that the
`Paint`
is filled with more than one color.
		
	
=== Shader
		
A shader allows to define for a
`Paint`
object the content which should be drawn. For example you can use a
`BitmapShader`
to define that a bitmap should be used to draw. This allows you for
example to draw an image with rounded corners. Simply define a
`BitmapShader`
for your
`Paint`
object and use the
`drawRoundRect()`
method to draw a rectancle with rounded corners.
		
		
Other _Shaders_ provided by the Android platform are `LinearGradient`, `RadialGradient` and `SweepGradient` for drawing color gradients.
		
		
To use a _Shaders_ assign it to your `Paint` object via the `setShader()` method.
		
		
If the area which is filled is larger than the
_Shaders_
you can define via the
_Shader tile mode_
how the rest should be filled. The
`Shader.TileMode.CLAMP`
constant
defines that the edge corners should be used to fill the
extra space, the
`Shader.TileMode.MIRROR`
constant defines that the image is mirrored and
`Shader.TileMode.REPEAT`
defines that the image will be repeated.
