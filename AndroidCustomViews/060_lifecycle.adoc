== Life cycle of a Andoid view

=== Life cycle events related to the window

A view is displayed if it is attached to a layout hierarchy
which is attached to a window. A view has several life cycle hooks.


The `onAttachedToWindow()` is called once the window is available.


The `onDetachedFromWindow()` is used when the view is removed from its parent (and if the parent is attached to a window). 
This happens for example if the activity is recycled (e.g. via the `finished()` method call) or if the view is recycled.

The `onDetachedFromWindow()` method can be used to stop animations and to clean up resources used by the view.


=== Traversal life cycle events

Traversals life cycle events consists of _Animate_, _Measure_, _Layout_ and _Draw_.

All views must know how to measure and layout themselves. 
The `requestLayout()` method call tells the view to measure and layout itself. 
As this operation may influence the layout of other views it calls also `requestLayout()` of its parent.

[TIP]
====
This recursive call is the reason why you should not nestle layout to deeply.
The measure and layout operation might be expensive if a lot of hierarchies are re-calculated.
====

The `onMeasure()` method determines the size for the view and its children. 
It must set the dimension via the `setMeasuredDimension()` method in this method call before returning.


The `onLayout()` positions the views based on the result of the `onMeasure()` method call. 
This call happens typically once, while `onMeasure()` can happen more than once.

=== Activity life cycle

Views don't have access to the life cycle events of the activities. 
If views want to get informed about these events, you should create an interface in the view which you call in the life cycle methods of the activity.
