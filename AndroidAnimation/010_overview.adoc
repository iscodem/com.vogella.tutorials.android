== Android Animations

=== Using animations
		
Android provides the _Properties Animation API_ which allow to change object properties over a pre-defined time interval.
It can be used for arbitrary object properties and on any object not only Android views.
		
=== Animator and AnimatorListener
		
The superclass of the animation API is the `Animator` class. 
Typically the `ObjectAnimator` class is used to modify the attributes of an object.
		
You can also add an `AnimatorListener` class to your `Animator` class.
This listener is called in the different phases of the animation. 
You can use this listener to perform actions before orafter a certain animation, e.g. add or remove a `View` from a `ViewGroup`.
		
=== ViewPropertyAnimator
		
The `ViewPropertyAnimator` class introduced in Android 3.1 provides  access to typical animations which are performed on views.
		
The `animate()` method on a `View` object returns the `ViewPropertyAnimator` object.
This object allows to perform simultaneous animations.
It has a fluent API and allows setting the duration of the animation.
		
The target of `ViewPropertyAnimator` is to provide a very simple API for typical animations.
		
The following code shows an example of the usage of this method.

For performance optimization you can also let `ViewPropertyAnimator` use a hardware layout.

include::res/viewproperty/TestHardware.java[]

You can also directly define a `Runnable` to be executed at the start and the end of the animation.

The `setInterpolator()` allows to define an object of type `TimeInterpolator` which defines the change of the value over time. 
The standard is
linear. The Android platform
defines a few default ones as for example
`AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator`
where the rate of change starts and ends slowly but accelerates
through the middle.
		
Via the
`setEvaluator`
method you can set an object of type
`TypeEvaluator`
which allow you to create animations on arbitrary property
types, by
providing custom evaluators for types that
are not automatically
understood and used by the animation system.
		
=== Layout animations
		
The
`LayoutTransition`
class allows setting animations on a layout container and a change on
the
view hierarchy
of this container will be animated.

=== Animations for Activity transition
		
Animations can be applied to
`Views`
but it is also possible to apply them on the transition between
activities.
		
The
`ActivityOptions`
class
allows defining defaults or customer animations.
